## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, working with [Prof. Jay Pujara](https://www.jaypujara.org/) and [Dr. Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/). I'm also fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Xiang Ren](http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/) and [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). My research interest lies in natural language processing and machine learning. In particular, I'm interested in developing information extraction models with minimal supervision. Before joining USC as a Ph.D. student, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from HKUST in 2018.
