## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

I'm a final-year Ph.D. candidate at University of Southern California working with [Prof. Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/). I'm also fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Xiang Ren](http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/) and [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). My research interest lies in natural language processing and machine learning. In particular, I'm interested in developing robust and generalizable information extraction systems. Before joining USC as a Ph.D. student, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from HKUST in 2018.

## Education
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Southern California, Aug. 2018 - Present.
* B.Sc. in Computer Science and B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Sep. 2014 - May 2018.
* Exchange student, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Jan. 2017 - May 2017.
